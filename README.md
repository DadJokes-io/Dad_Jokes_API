# Overview

This section should contain an overview of the data provided and the API purpose.

#### USING THE API

We built this API to have an unlimited supply of dad jokes for our [DadJokes](https://github.com/KegenGuyll/Dad_Jokes) application.
If you find yourself overwhelmed, we organized this documentation into four major areas.

- [Getting started](#getting-started) introduces you to the operations offered by the API.
- [API calls](#api-calls) gives you examples of those operations
- [Field reference](#field-reference) Lists and describes the type of information provided by the API

# Getting Started
